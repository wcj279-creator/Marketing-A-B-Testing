# Marketing-A-B-Testing
A/B test analysis of a marketing campaign to determine statistical significance and provide a data-driven business recommendation.

**Overview
This project is a complete analysis of a sample A/B test for a marketing campaign. The primary goal was to determine whether a new "ad" (treatment) provided a statistically significant improvement in user conversion rate compared to the existing "psa" (control).

This analysis demonstrates a practical application of data-driven decision-making, translating raw data from a marketing_AB.csv file into an actionable business recommendation.

**Project Goals
Clean and prepare the raw test data, ensuring data integrity.

Define the null and alternative hypotheses.

Perform a two-proportion z-test to determine statistical significance.

Provide a clear, data-driven recommendation for non-technical stakeholders.

**Tech Stack
Python: The core language for the analysis.

Jupyter Notebook: For iterative analysis and documentation.

Pandas: Used for data loading, cleaning, and manipulation.

Statsmodels: Used to perform the statistical (two-proportion z-test).

**The Dataset
The dataset used is a public A/B testing dataset from Kaggle. It contains user IDs and information on which test group they were in (ad or psa) and whether they converted.
